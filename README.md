# Jennifer Engle - Password Generate
Module 3 Challenge

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a webpage a user can use to have a randomized password generated that follows the input parameters the user provides.

Expected Behavior:
Upon click of the "Generate Password" button, a series of window prompts appear asking for user input. "OK" will be the button for the "Yes" response and "Cancel" will be the button for the "No" response. 

The order of the prompts is as follows:
1. How long do you want your password? Provide a whole number between 8 & 128.

  - If the user chooses below 8 or above 128, an additional prompt appears asking for a valid entry.

## Project status
This project is incomplete. I have yet to get the Math.random and the split functions to work. I am happy with what I have otherwise and will resubmit when I have a better understanding of how those work.
