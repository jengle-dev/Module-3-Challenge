# Jennifer Engle - Password Generator

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a webpage a user can use to have a randomized password generated that follows the input parameters the user provides.

Expected Behavior:
Upon click of the "Generate Password" button, a series of window prompts appear asking for user input. "OK" will be the button for the "Yes" response and "Cancel" will be the button for the "No" response. 

The order of the prompts is as follows:
1. How long do you want your password? Provide a whole number between 8 & 128. </br>

- If the user chooses below 8 or above 128, an additional prompt appears asking for a valid entry.</br>

## Project status
There is additional code I'd like to work out. I'd like to allow the user to exit the question prompts if the length parameter is not met. This would allow them to start over.
